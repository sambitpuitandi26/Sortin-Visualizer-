No more sorting specific visualizer code! How about we write one generic visualizer code in Python and push our driver code and functions to any sorting algo implementation in the internet and actually watch the sorting in progress.

As a proof of versatility, several examples were taken from the internet. The credit for writing those sorting codes go to the rightful owners. This tutorial doesn't focus on sorting mechanism, we just want to have fun witnessing sorting in progress.

This piece of code is tested with different sorting algo implementations available in the internet and it is working with each and everyone of them.
